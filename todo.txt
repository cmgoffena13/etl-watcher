1. Implement log cleanup endpoint
2. Create an audit log framework for auditing pipelines 
    to provide information on Completeness and Accuracy (and then anomaly alerting on that as well)
3. Look into Celery for background tasks like anomaly and timeliness checks to have response time to be faster
4. Check that the anomaly and timeliness indexes are actually being used
    (Will have to get the queries from SQLAlchemy and trigger in DBeaver with EXPLAIN)
5. Think about throughput. Endpoint to showcase?
